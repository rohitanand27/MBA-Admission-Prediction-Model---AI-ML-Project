## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing MBA applicants' data to understand which factors contribute most to admission decisions.  
Using a dataset with features like **GPA**, **GMAT scores**, **Work Experience**, and **Academic Background**, we develop an interpretable ML model to predict admission chances.
