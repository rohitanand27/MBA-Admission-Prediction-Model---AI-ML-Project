## 🧠 Project Description

This project explores an MBA admissions dataset to:
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Understand feature importance like **GPA**, **GMAT scores**, and **Work Experience**
- Build a predictive model for **admission decisions**

It demonstrates the practical use of **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn** to turn raw data into actionable insights.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is named `MBA1.csv` and includes various candidate attributes.  
Place it in the root directory before running the notebook.
